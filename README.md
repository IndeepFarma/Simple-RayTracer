Simple Ray Tracer

I have included the sample A4 input given as well as another sample input file to show multiple spheres working.

You may change the N value of the Specular light on lines 401, 402, and 403 respectively in index.html. The current 
    value it is set to is at 128.

To run:
    In terminal type in: 
        python3 -m http.server
        Open Google Chrome
        Go to local host 8000

There is a choose file button on the bottom left of the screen where you may choose a file to test
